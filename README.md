- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new project. 
- ğŸŒ± I have learnt basic HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
- ğŸŒ± I have even touched advanced CSS, working with advanced properties like transform creating various animations and creating layouts with grid and flex.
- ğŸŒ± Talking of HTML, have learnt semantics, a part of accessibility (screen readers too).
- ğŸŒ± I have worked with some WEB apis and third party apis too (which don't require any api key).
